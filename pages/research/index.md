In July 2007, I completed a PhD at the <a href =
"http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/ctm/">Centre for Technology Management</a>,
University of Cambridge.  My research focused on quality management in free
software projects, with an emphasis on release management.

While some free software projects show a high level of quality, often on
par or even surpassing that of proprietary software, there are a number of
unique challenges free software projects face.  One central question is how
free software projects can ensure a constant high level of quality when
many of the participants are volunteers whose involvement in a project
changes constantly.

The aim of my research was to identify existing quality related problems in
open source projects and to use the outcomes as a starting point for the
development of quality improvement strategies.  In exploratory interviews
with a number of free software developers, release management has been
found to be a problematic area and the research subsequently focused on
this topic in particular as one aspect of quality management.

There are several reasons why release management in free software projects
is often associated with problems.  First of all, many maintainers of
software are programmers who do not necessarily have the coordination and
management skills needed for release management.  Secondly, during a
release, extra commitment from project participants is required in order to
meet deadlines but volunteers may not be able to put in more work than
usual.  Finally, there is often a dichotomy between the requirements of
users and developers.  Since developers mainly use development releases,
they might not see the need for a well tested and stable release aimed at
less technical and corporate users.

Inadequate release management can lead to a number of problems, such as
software which is out of date, breaks compatibility, does not meet the
quality standards or the requirements of users.  This research has
identified such problems, has identified good practices in free software
and has developed further processes and techniques to improve release
management in free software projects.
