Installations on Cobalt machines without a serial console are supported by
using SSH.  Please follow the <a href = "../install/">installation
instructions</a> to install Debian via SSH.  If you don't have <a href =
"../lowmem/">enough memory</a> to run the installer, you can <a href =
"../unpack/">manually unpack</a> a tar ball provided by me.
