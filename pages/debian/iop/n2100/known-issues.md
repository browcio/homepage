Here is a list of known issues and bugs with Debian on the Thecus N2100.

<h2>Debian 7 (wheezy) with 3.2 kernel</h2>

<ul>

<li>Disk access is slow because of lack of support for the DMA engine on
the IOP32x chip.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Debian 8 (jessie)</h2>

* The IOP32x platform is no longer supported.  This means that support
for the Thecus N2100 was dropped.
