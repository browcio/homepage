<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<h3>Which Plug Computers are supported by Debian?</h3>

There are many different Plug Computer models.  The SheevaPlug is the
original one and it is well supported.  Please check which <a href =
"../plugs/">other models</a> are supported.

<h3>How much space do I need to install Debian?</h3>

A normal installation of Debian (i.e. base system plus standard components)
will take about 400 MB, so a 1 GB USB stick or SD card is enough (even
though more is recommended).
