I have documented my experience in getting Debian to work on various
hardware platforms.  Generic information about Debian can be found on the
<a href = "http://www.debian.org/">project's official web page</a> and
there is also a good <a href =
"http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual">installation
manual</a>.  The HOWTOs I currently provide are about the following
hardware platforms:

<ul>

<li><a href = "kirkwood/">Devices based on Marvell's Kirkwood platform</a>
(such as SheevaPlug and QNAP TS-219P).</li>

<li><a href = "orion/">Devices based on Marvell's Orion platform</a> (such
as QNAP TS-109, TS-209 and TS-409).</li>

</ul>

The following information is obsolete:

<ul>

<li><a href = "nslu2/">Linksys NSLU2</a> (Network Storage Link for USB 2.0
Disk Drives)</li>

<li>Using the <a href = "gps/bt-q1000x/">Qstarz BT-Q1000X</a> GPS on
Debian.</li>

<li><a href = "iop/">Intel IOP</a> based devices, such as the Thecus
N2100.</li>

<li><a href = "cobalt/">MIPS based Cobalt machines</a> (RaQ, Qube2, RaQ2,
Gateway Microserver).</li>

</ul>
