<h1>Debian on D-Link DNS-323 and Conceptronic CH3SNAS</h1>

The D-Link DNS-323 (revision A1 and B1, but not C1) and Conceptronic
CH3SNAS (Grab'n'GO) devices were supported by Debian thanks to work done by
Matt Palmer.  Please note that support for these devices was dropped in
Debian 9 (stretch).

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

Herbert Valerio Riedel added kernel support for the DNS-323 revision A1.
Matt Palmer added kernel support for the DNS-323 revision B1 and ported the
Debian installer to the DNS-323.  Conceptronic kindly provided two CH3SNAS
devices to Debian and Alan Fletcher made a cable for me so I could access the
serial console.
