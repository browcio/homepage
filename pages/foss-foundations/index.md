I conducted research on FOSS Foundations and published two reports:

## Growing Open Source Projects with a Stable Foundation

This primer covers non-technical aspects that the majority of projects will have to consider at some point.  It also explains how FOSS foundations can help projects grow and succeed.

This primer explains:

* What issues and areas to consider
* How other projects and foundations have approached these topics
* What FOSS foundations bring to the table
* How to choose a FOSS foundation

You can download [Growing Open Source Projects with a Stable Foundation](growing-open-source-projects.pdf).

## Research report

The research report describes the findings of the research and aims to help understand the operations and challenges FOSS foundations face.

This report covers topics such as:

* Role and activities of foundations
* Challenges faced and gaps in the service offerings
* Operational aspects, including reasons for starting an org and choice of jurisdiction
* Trends, such as the "foundation in a foundation" model
* Recommendations for different stakeholders
