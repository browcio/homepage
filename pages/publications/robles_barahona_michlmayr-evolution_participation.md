<h2>Abstract</h2>

Most libre software projects rely on the work of volunteers.  Therefore,
attracting people who contribute their time and technical skills is of
paramount importance, both in technical and economic terms.  This reliance
on volunteers leads to some fundamental management challenges: volunteer
contributions are inherently difficult to predict, plan and manage,
especially in the case of large projects.  In this paper we analyze the
evolution in time of the human resources of one of the largest and most
complex libre software projects composed primarily of volunteers, the
Debian project.  Debian currently has around 1300 volunteers working on
several tasks: much activity is focused on packaging software applications
and libraries, but there is also major work related to the maintenance of
the infrastructure needed to sustain the development.  We have performed a
quantitative investigation of data from almost seven years, studying how
volunteer involvement has affected the software released, and the developer
community itself.
