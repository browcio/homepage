<h2>Abstract</h2>

With the success of libre (free, open source) software, a new type of
software compilation has become increasingly common. Such compilations,
often referred to as &lsquo;distributions&rsquo;, group hundreds, if not
thousands, of software applications and libraries written by independent
parties into an integrated system.  Software compilations raise a number of
questions that have not been targeted so far by software evolution, which
usually focuses on the evolution of single applications.  Undoubtedly, the
challenges that software compilations face differ from those found in
single software applications. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that both,
the evolution of applications and that of software compilations, have
similarities and dependencies.

In this sense, we identify a dichotomy, common to that in economics, of
software evolution in the small (micro-evolution) and in the large
(macro-evolution).  The goal of this paper is to study the evolution of a
large software compilation, mining the publicly available repository of a
well-known Linux distribution, Debian.  We will therefore investigate
changes related to hundreds of millions of lines of code over seven years.
The aspects that will be covered in this paper are size (in terms of number
of packages and of number of lines of code), use of programming languages,
maintenance of packages and file sizes.
