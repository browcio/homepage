<h2>Abstract</h2>

The success of free software and open source projects has
increased interest in utilizing the open source model for mature
software development.  However, the ad hoc nature of open source
development may result in poor quality software or failures for
a number of volunteer projects.  In this paper, projects from
SourceForge are assessed to test the hypothesis that there is a
relationship between process maturity and the success of free
software and open source projects.  This study addresses the
question of whether the maturity of particular software
processes differs in unsuccessful and unsuccessful projects.
Processes are identified which are key factors in successful
free software projects.  The insights gained from this study can
be used improve the software process used by free software
projects.
