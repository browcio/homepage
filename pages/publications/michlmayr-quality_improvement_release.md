<h2>Abstract</h2>

Even though free software has achieved great popularity and success in
recent years, there are a number of product quality challenges facing the
open source development model.  There is significant room for further
quality improvement and one area that deserves special attention is release
management.  This research will identify problems with current release
practices, verify possible advantages of an increasingly popular release
model, and develop interventions to improve release management in free
software projects.  The research also aims to answer the fundamental
question as to how volunteer projects can deliver predictable and high
quality software.
