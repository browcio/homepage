<h2>Abstract</h2>

Some free software and open source projects have been extremely successful
in the past.  The success of a project is often related to the number of
developers it can attract: a larger community of developers identifies and
corrects more software defects and adds more features via a peer-review
process.  This type of community has been termed &quot;bazaar&quot;, and
its creation and continuity have been recognized as crucial factors for the
success of free software projects.

In this paper two free software projects are empirically explored in order
to characterize their software lifecycle, development processes and
communities.  It is argued that both the &quot;cathedral&quot; and
&quot;bazaar&quot; phases can be found in free software projects, and that
the transition between the two phases is the key factor of the truly
popular ones.

The first conclusion of this paper is that the bazaar phase is
characterized by a growing trend of new developers joining the project:
consequently, a similar growing pattern will be observed in the output
produced.  The second conclusion is that new developers tend to work on the
most recent modules first: consequently, projects failing to develop new
modules will not attract new developers.
