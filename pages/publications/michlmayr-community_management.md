<h2>Abstract</h2>

The increasing complexity of communities established around free and open
source software (FOSS) projects as well as the increasing commercial
interest in such projects has led to more and more communities adopting a
dedicated community manager position.  The community manager acts as the
liaison between company and community and ensures that there is a good
relationship between the two.  They also facilitate the community, help it
grow and ensure that the community stays healthy.  This paper will discuss
community management in FOSS projects and look at the role of the community
manager position.
