<h2>Abstract</h2>

Free and open source software has had a major impact on the computer
industry since the late 1990s and has changed the way software is
perceived, developed and deployed in many areas.  Free and open source
software, or FOSS, is typically developed in a collaborative fashion and
the majority of contributors are volunteers.  Even though this
collaborative form of development has produced a significant body of
software, the development process is often described as unstructured and
unorganized.  This dissertation studies the FOSS phenomenon from a quality
perspective and investigates where improvements to the development process
are possible.  In particular, the focus is on release management since this
is concerned with the delivery of a high quality product to end-users.

This research has identified considerable interest amongst the FOSS
community in a novel release management strategy, time based releases.  In
contrast to traditional development which is feature-driven, time based
releases use time rather than features as the criterion for the creation of
a new release.  Releases are made after a specific interval, and new
features that have been completed and sufficiently tested since the last
release are included in the new version.

This dissertation explores why, and under which circumstances, the time
based release strategy is a viable alternative to feature-driven
development and discusses factors that influence a successful
implementation of this release strategy.  It is argued that this release
strategy acts as a coordination mechanism in large volunteer projects that
are geographically dispersed.  The time based release strategy allows a
more controlled development and release process in projects which have
little control of their contributors and therefore contributes to the
quality of the output.
