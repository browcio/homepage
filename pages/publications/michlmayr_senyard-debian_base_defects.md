<h2>Abstract</h2>

It has been argued that free software and open source projects
benefit from a high level of user involvement.  Users influence
the direction of a project through feature requests, and their
identification of bugs and defects in the software contribute to
high levels of quality.  In this paper, we present a number of
statistical analyses based on over 7,000 defect reports which
have been recorded about the free software project Debian.
These analysis are used to make observations on the
effectiveness of the open source development process used by
projects such as Debian and recommendations on how to improve
this process.
