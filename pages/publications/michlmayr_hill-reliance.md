<h2>Abstract</h2>

It has been suggested that the superior quality of many Free Software
projects in comparison to their proprietary counterparts is in part due to
the Free Software community's extensive source code peer-review process.
While many argue that software is best developed by individuals or small
teams, the process of debugging is highly parallizable.  This "one and
many" model describes a template employed by many Free Software projects.
However, reliance on a single developer or maintainer creates a single
point of failure that raises a number of serious quality and reliability
concerns -- especially when considered in the context of the
volunteer-based nature of most Free Software projects.  This paper will
investigate the nature of problems raised by this model within the Debian
Project and will explore several possible strategies aimed at removing or
de-emphasizing the reliance on individual developers.
