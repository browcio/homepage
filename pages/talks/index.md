I regularly give talks about Debian and Free Software.  Below, I have a
partial listing of upcoming as well as previous talks.  If you are
interested in inviting me to give a talk, please see my <a href =
"../contact/">contact details</a>.  I can talk about quality assurance and
project management in Free Software, philosophy of Free Software, and
Debian (either in general or possibly a specific topic).
