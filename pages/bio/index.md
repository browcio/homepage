I'm a contributor to various free and open source software projects.
I have Master degrees in Psychology, Philosophy, and Software
Engineering and a PhD in Technology Management.

My big passion is free software and open source.  Unlike traditional
software, free software comes with certain freedoms, such as the right to
freely distribute, study and improve the software.  I'm interested in free
software for two reasons.  First, I believe in the concept of free software
and that users should be given those freedoms.  Second, free software
projects are often carried out by volunteers and I see project and quality
management in distributed volunteer projects as an exciting challenge.  I
have been involved in various free software projects for over 15 years.  I
used to be the volunteer coordinator for the GNUstep project and acted as
publicity director for Linux International.  In 2000, I joined the Debian
project an association of roughly 1000 volunteers working on an operating
system completely based on free software; I acted as the leader of Debian
for two years.  I served on the Board of Directors of the Open Source
Initiative (OSI).  I currently serve on the boards of Software Freedom
Conservancy and Software in the Public Interest.

Apart from spending time at the computer, I like to read, listen to music
and I also travel a lot.  I have a curious fascination with the ocean and
one of my favourite activities is to spend time at a beach.  I have been to
a number of amazing beaches over the last few years (such as Manly and
Coogee beach in Sydney and Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro).

I'm fairly busy but I'm quite approachable and actually pretty good at
responding to e-mail.  If you'd like to get in contact to discuss anything
found on this web site, see my [contact page](../contact/).  I also maintain
a [blog](../blog/) which I update every now and then.
