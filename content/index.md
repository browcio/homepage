I'm a contributor to various free and open source software projects, such
as Debian, with an interest in project management and quality assurance.  I
work for HP's Open Source Program Office as an Open Source Community
Expert.  More information about me can be found in [my biography](bio).

On this site, I offer instructions for installing and using Debian on
various devices, such as the [SheevaPlug](debian/kirkwood/sheevaplug) and
various [NAS devices from QNAP](debian/kirkwood/qnap).  I also maintain a
[blog](journal).
