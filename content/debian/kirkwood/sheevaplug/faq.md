<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<h3>Which Plug Computers are supported by Debian?</h3>

There are many different Plug Computer models.  The SheevaPlug is the
original one and it is well supported.  Please check which <a href =
"../plugs">other models</a> are supported.

<h3>How much space do I need to install Debian?</h3>

A normal installation of Debian (i.e. base system plus standard components)
will take about 400 MB, so a 1 GB USB stick or SD card is enough (even
though more is recommended).

<h3>Can I buy the SheevaPlug in Europe?</h3>

Yes, the SheevaPlug is now also available from <a href =
"http://www.newit.co.uk/">New IT</a> in the UK.

<h3>Will the SheevaPlug work in Europe?</h3>

Yes.  The SheevaPlug will work with 110v and 220v.  If you buy the
SheevaPlug from the US, you can simply remove the US connector and then
connect a so called "figure 8" cable.  However, NewIT in the UK offers the
SheevaPlug with EU 2 pin and UK 3 pin power adapters.

<h3>Why is my kernel not being updated automatically?</h3>

During the upgrade process, new kernel packages will be installed
automatically and a ramdisk is generated.  The SheevaPlug doesn't boot
those files directly though and requires special images for u-boot.  These
images are generated by the tool `flash-kernel` under Debian.  However, due
to a bug, `flash-kernel` is currently not ran automatically when you
install a kernel, so you have to run it manually.
