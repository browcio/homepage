<h1>Debian on Kirkwood devices</h1>

Kirkwood is a system on a chip (SoC) from Marvell that integrates an ARM
CPU, Ethernet, SATA, USB, SDIO and other functionality in one chip.
Kirkwood is targeted at Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices, digital
home media servers, plug computers and other devices.  Kirkwood based
devices are a great platform to run Debian and together with Debian they
can be a very powerful environment.

Debian supports a number of Kirkwood based devices.  There are additional
pages with instructions and information about all supported devices:

<ul>
<li><a href = "openrd/">OpenRD</a></li>
<li><a href = "qnap/">QNAP Turbo NAS (TS-11x, TS-12x, TS-21x, TS-22x, TS-41x and TS-42x)</a></li>
<li><a href = "sheevaplug/">Plug computers (SheevaPlug, GuruPlug and DreamPlug)</a></li>
</ul>
