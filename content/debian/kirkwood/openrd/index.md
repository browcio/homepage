<h1>Debian on the OpenRD platform</h1>

OpenRD is a reference design for Marvell's Kirkwood platform (Marvell's
88F6281 System On Chip).  There are three variants: the OpenRD-Base, the
OpenRD-Client and the OpenRD-Ultimate.  You can install Debian on all of
these devices and use them as an ARM development environment.
