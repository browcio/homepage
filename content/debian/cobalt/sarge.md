<h1>Debian sarge on MIPS based Cobalt machines</h1>

<b>Note:</b> Debian 3.1 (sarge) is very old and no longer supported.
Please use my generic <a href = "../install/">installation page</a> to
install the current version of Debian.

If you link to this page, please update your page and link to
`http://www.cyrius.com/debian/cobalt/install/` instead.

Go back to my <a href = "..">Debian on Cobalt</a> page.
