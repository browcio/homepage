<h1>Debian on the Fulong mini-PC</h1>

The Fulong Miniature Computer (mini-PC) is an inexpensive computer based on
the Loongson chip.  It features:

<ul>

<li>Loongson 2E CPU running at 666 MHz</li>

<li>40 GB 2.5" IDE hard drive</li>

<li>256 MB RAM (one mini-DDR slot)</li>

<li>1 Ethernet</li>

<li>4 USB ports</li>

<li>1 PS2 port</li>

<li>1 COM port</li>

<li>Audio interfaces</li>

<li>Output: VGA and TV out</li>

</ul>

The Fulong mini-PC comes pre-installed with a version of Debian.  I've
taken a <a href = "gallery/">few images</a> of the Fulong mini-PC.

Please note that I no longer have my Fulong mini-PC, so I cannot answer any
questions about it.
