<h2>Abstract</h2>

Release management plays an important role in every software project since
it is concerned with the delivery of a high quality product to end-users.
This paper explores release practices employed by volunteer free software
projects and shows problems that occur.  A challenge that has been
identified is the difficulty of coordinating a distributed team of
volunteers in order to align their work for a release.
