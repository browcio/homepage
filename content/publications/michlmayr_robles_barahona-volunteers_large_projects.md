<h2>Abstract</h2>

Most libre (free, open source) software projects rely on the work of
volunteers. Therefore, attracting people who contribute their time
and technical skills is of paramount importance, both in technical
and economic terms.  This reliance on volunteers leads to some
fundamental management challenges: volunteer contributions are
inherently difficult to predict, plan and manage, especially in the
case of large projects.  In this chapter we present an analysis of
the evolution over time of the human resources in large libre
software projects, using the Debian project, one of the largest and
most complex libre software projects based mainly in voluntary work,
as a case study. We have performed a quantitative investigation of
data corresponding to roughly seven years, studying how volunteer
involvement has affected the software released by the project, and
the developer community itself.
