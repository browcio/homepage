<h2>Abstract</h2>

Free software and open source projects are often perceived to be of high
quality.  It has been suggested that the high level of quality found in
some free software projects is related to the open development model which
promotes peer review.  While the quality of some free software projects is
comparable to if not better than that of closed source software, not all
free software projects are successful and of high quality.  Even mature and
successful projects face quality problems, some of which are related to the
unique characteristics of free software and open source as a distributed
development model based primarily on volunteers.  In exploratory interviews
performed with free software and open source developers, common quality
practices as well as actual quality problems have been identified.  The
results of these interviews are presented in this paper to take stock of
the current status of quality in free software projects and to act as a
starting point for the implementation of quality process improvement
strategies.
