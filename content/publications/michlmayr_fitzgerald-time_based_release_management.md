<h2>Abstract</h2>

As the Free and Open Source (FOSS) concept has matured, its commercial
significance has also increased, and issues such as quality and sustainability
have moved to the fore. In this study, the authors focus on time-based release
management in large volunteer FOSS projects, and reveal how they address
quality and sustainability issues. They discuss the differences between release
management in the traditional software context and contrast it with FOSS
settings. Based on detailed case studies of a number of prominent FOSS
projects, they describe the move to time-based release management and identify
the factors and criteria necessary for a successful transition. The authors
also consider the implications for software development more generally in the
current dynamic Internet-enabled environment.
