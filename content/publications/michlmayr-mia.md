<h2>Abstract</h2>

During the last few years, thousands of volunteers have created a large
body of free software. Even though this accomplishment shows that the free
software development model works, there are some drawbacks associated with
this model. Due to the volunteer nature of most free software projects, it
is impossible to fully rely on participants. Volunteers may become busy and
neglect their duties. This may lead to a steady decrease of quality as work
is not being carried out. The problem of inactive volunteers is intensified
by the fact that most free software projects are distributed, which makes
it hard to quickly identify volunteers who neglect their duties. This paper
shows Debian's approach to inactive volunteers. Insights presented here can
be applied to other free software projects in order to implement effective
quality assurance strategies.
