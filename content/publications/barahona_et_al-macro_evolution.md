<h2>Abstract</h2>

Software evolution studies have traditionally focused on individual
products.  In this study we scale up the idea of software evolution by
considering software compilations composed of a large quantity of
independently developed products, engineered to work together.  With the
success of libre (free, open source) software, these compilations have
become common in the form of `software distributions', which group hundreds
or thousands of software applications and libraries into an integrated
system.  We have performed an exploratory case study on one of them, Debian
GNU/Linux, finding some significant results.  First, Debian has been
doubling in size every 2 years, totalling about 300 million lines of code
as of 2007.  Second, the mean size of packages has remained stable over
time.  Third, the number of dependencies between packages has been growing
quickly.  Finally, while C is still by far the most commonly used
programming language for applications, use of the C++, Java, and Python
languages have all significantly increased.  The study helps not only to
understand the evolution of Debian, but also yields insights into the
evolution of mature libre software systems in general.
