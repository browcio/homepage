<h2>Abstract</h2>

Some free software projects have been extremely successful. This rise to
prominence can be attributed to the high quality and suitability of the
software. This quality and suitability is achieved through an elaborate
peer-review process performed by a large community of users, who act as
co-developers to identify and correct software defects and add features.
Although this process is crucial to the success of free software projects,
there is more to the free software development than the creation of a
&lsquo;bazaar&rsquo;.  In this paper we draw on existing free software
projects to define a lifecycle model for free software. This paper then
explores each phase of the lifecycle model and agrees that, while the
bazaar phase attracts the most attention, it is the initial modular design
that accommodates diverse interventions. Moreover, it is the period of
transition from the initial group to the larger community based development
that is crucial in determining whether a free software project will succeed
or fail.
