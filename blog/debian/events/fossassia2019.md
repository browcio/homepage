I attended [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/) earlier this month.  This
conference has been on my radar for many years but I never managed to
attend before.

I was impressed by the organization of the conference.  Furthermore, I
liked that the audience was completely different to the conferences I
normally attend.  There were so many new people.  FOSSASIA has grown not
just to be a conference, but also an umbrella organization for several
open source projects.

I gave a talk about open source culture, using Debian as an example.  I
find this type of presentation important because this is where a lot of
pitfalls are for many new contributors.  Learning technologies is easy,
but figuring out all the unwritten norms and rules of a community can be
daunting.  Of course, it was particularly interesting to give this talk
in an environment where I'm the cultural outsider.  While I've visited
a number of Asian countries, there's a lot about the different cultures
I have yet to learn.

I met a number of Debian contributors, including Andrew Lee, Norbert
Preining (who talked about TeX Live), Graham Williams (who used to
contribute to Debian in the early days and heads an AI team at Microsoft
in Singapore now), Kai Hendry (who used to contribute to Debian) and
others.  I also spent some time away from the conference to write [my
DPL platform](https://www.debian.org/vote/2019/platforms/tbm).

Thank you to Hong Phuc Dang, Mario Behling and all the other organizers
and volunteers for a wonderful event!
