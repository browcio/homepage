I attended the Open Nordic Conference in Norway in June, a conference that
brought together people from Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.
Attending the conference allowed me to find out what's going on with FOSS
in Northern Europe.  What I found interesting is that there was a lot of
talk about using FOSS in the public sector.  A number of countries are
working on repositories to exchange software, in particular for public
administration.

One example is the Software Exchange (softwareborsen.dk), a project by the
Danish National Software Knowledge Centre to promote the use of FOSS in
Danish public administration.  The Norwegian software exchange
(delingsbazaren.no) plays a similar role in Norway.

It seems as if every country is working on their own software repository to
share FOSS.  As such, it's great to see that the European Commission is
taking a step towards bringing everyone together by introducing the
Open Source Observatory and Repository (OSOR)
for European public administrations.  The goal of OSOR is to provide a
platform for the exchange of information, experiences and FOSS code for the
use in public administrations.

OSOR will officially launch at the Open Source World Conference in Malaga
in October.  I've always thought that there is not enough cooperation and
communication between European countries, so I have high hopes for OSOR.
