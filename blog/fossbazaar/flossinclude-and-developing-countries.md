The EU is sponsoring a new two year project called <a href =
FLOSSInclude to explore the use of FOSS as a
development tool.  In particular, the aim of FLOSSInclude is to study what
is needed to &quot;increase the deployment, development and societal impact
of FOSS in Africa, Asia and Latin America&quot;.  The project starts with
the premise that FOSS provides a number of benefits to developing
countries, such as low cost, adaptability, and a free-of-charge high
quality training environment.

The project will identify and analyze key problem areas and areas of
blocked potential in the target regions.  Furthermore, pilot studies will
be conducted to ensure that FOSS solutions, tools and services can be
cost-effective and practical for each environment.  At the end of the
project, FLOSSInclude intends to develop a roadmap for future EU
development research cooperation in order to &quot;ensure that the impact
of FLOSSInclude will be sustained far beyond the duration of the
project&quot;.  I think it's great that there is a research project now
with the focus on including developing countries in FOSS and I hope this
project will be very successful.
