Stefano Zacchiroli and I released
[ledger2beancount](https://github.com/zacchiro/ledger2beancount/), a
script to convert ledger files to beancount.
[Ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/) is a bookkeeping system based on
text files.  [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/) is another tool
which follows a similar approach but which from my point of view is the
way forward.

ledger2beancount supports most of the features and syntax of ledger.
It also includes some features to improve the conversion from ledger
to beancount.  The supported ledger features are described in the
[README](https://github.com/zacchiro/ledger2beancount/) and
there's a manual with detailed descriptions of ledger2beancount's
features.  There's also an illustrated example showing some of the
differences between ledger and beancount.

Martin Blais released beancount 2.0 a few days ago, so this is a good
time to give it a go.  Beancount has a web UI called
[fava](https://beancount.github.io/fava/) which is absolutely fantastic.
