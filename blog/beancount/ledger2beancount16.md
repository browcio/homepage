Stefano Zacchiroli and I released version 1.6 of [ledger2beancount](https://github.com/zacchiro/ledger2beancount),
a ledger to beancount converter.

This release contains a number of bug fixes and a new feature:

* Add support for fixated prices and costs
* Handle account names that contain brackets
* Don't parse trailing tabs as part of the account name
* Escape backslashes in the narration

You can get [ledger2beancount from GitHub](https://github.com/zacchiro/ledger2beancount).
