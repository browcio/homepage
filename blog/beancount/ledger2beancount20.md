I released version 2.0 of [ledger2beancount](https://github.com/zacchiro/ledger2beancount),
a ledger to beancount converter.

Here are the changes in 2.0:

* Handle comments in `account` and `commodity` declarations
* Handle transactions with a single posting (without `bucket`)
* Handle empty metadata values
* Rewrite Emacs modeline

You can get [ledger2beancount from GitHub](https://github.com/zacchiro/ledger2beancount).
