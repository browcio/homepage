As I'm nearing the completion of my PhD, I'm starting to write about the
findings from my research.  The aim of my PhD is to investigate quality
improvement in free software projects.  After some exploratory studies
about quality in free software, I decided to focus on release management as
one problematic area in which improvement is possible.  My approach is to
study the development process of projects and to investigate ways how these
processes can be improved.  The hope is that such improvements will lead to
increased levels of quality in the software produced by free software
projects.

With regard to release management, I'm focusing especially on large and
complex projects, in which hundreds of volunteers need to be coordinated
during release preparations.  I've been looking particularly at time based
release management since my exploratory studies have shown that there is
significant interest in this release management strategy.  The main
question of my research is how and why time based release management works
for large free software projects.

In my first series of postings, I will introduce the seven free software
projects I have studied in depth during my research.  For each project, I
will briefly summarize what problems the project faced in the past, what
changes they have implemented to address these problems, and what
outstanding problems they still have.
