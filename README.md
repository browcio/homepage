# Homepage of Martin Michlmayr

This is the source for my personal homepage at <http://www.cyrius.com/>

I am currently in the process of converting this site to [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/).

## Requirements

Ruby dependencies are managed using bundler:
    bundle install

The site also requires various Debian packages:
    apt-get install hunspell hunspell myspell-en-gb
